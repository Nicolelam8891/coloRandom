### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built a project that is a web application that generates a randomized color palette for users. Users are presented with various random colors that they can choose to "save." Users can "lock" a color to ensure it remains fixed when generating new palettes. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We are manipulating the page after it loads by removing, adding, and updating elements on the DOM. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Fork repository from the following URL: https://github.com/Nicolelam8891/coloRandom.
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command “git clone” following the SSH link. 
Navigate into the cloned repository by using the command cd followed by the name of the repository you specified during cloning. 
Open up repository with your preferred text editor. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We worked collaboratively Tuesday-Saturday, everyday. We worked around 3-8h/day. 
We are in Mod 1, week 4.
